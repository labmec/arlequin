# arlequin
Project to implement the Arlequin method using NeoPZ

## Usage
First, install NeoPZ according to the instructions in the GitHub repository.

Then, this project can be configured through CMake. Since some projects rely on graphical output in the `vtk` format, it is recommended to use [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) for visualization.
